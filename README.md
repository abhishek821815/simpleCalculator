Simple Calculator â€“ Project Description
Overview:
The Simple Calculator is a basic web application that performs standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.


Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure of the calculator, including input buttons and display area.
CSS: Adds styling to the calculator, including layout, colors, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Handles the logic behind each operation and updates the display in real-time.

Features:
User-friendly interface with a responsive design.
Real-time calculation on button click.
Clear (C) button to reset all inputs.
Input validation to prevent errors (e.g., division by zero).
Simple and clean layout mimicking physical calculators.


How It Works:
Users click on the number and operator buttons.
The JavaScript script appends these values to a display.
When the equal (=) button is clicked, the input is evaluated and the result is shown.
The clear (C) button resets the display.
